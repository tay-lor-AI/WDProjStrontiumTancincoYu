Bored in the summer? Want to take a break from schoolwork? Don't worry! We've got you covered! With the press of a quick button, we can randomly generate a fandom that might interest you, be it a book, show, or game!

__Home__ (Includes Random Button, will incorporate JS, when button ROLL is tapped, it will open a random _Results Page_)

__Complete List__ (Don't want it random? Sure, here's a list of all of the fandoms!)

__How to join a Fandom__ (Contains basic steps on how to start your deep dive into a new world!)

__Sources__ (Contains sources and citations, also social media links)

__Result Pages__ - Each possible fandom result will have their own seperate webpage. Ideally with no sub-pages
