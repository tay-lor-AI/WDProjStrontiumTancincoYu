                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>Hollow Knight and Hollow Knight: Silksong are metroidvania games where you play as a little
                            bug
                            and traverse through a really mean stinky world. In both games you fight a variety of
                            enemies and bosses, and
                            try to figure out what happened to the vast ruined kingdom that you find yourself in, and if
                            there is any way to
                            save it.

                        <p> Hollow Knight is pretty hard and it makes my fingers hurty, which is good because hard
                            things are fun. I haven't
                            been able to play Silksong, but I've heard it's marginally harder than its predecessor. The
                            games may be hard, but
                            they're also fair and give you tools and gear to politely execute your enemies with. The
                            games also just looks gorgeous,
                            and I like how you can break a lot of the background objects because that's funny. Great
                            experience and fun, if you like
