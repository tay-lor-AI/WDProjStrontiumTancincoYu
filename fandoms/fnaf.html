                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>FNAF is a game series where you have to survive the night against multiple animatronics.
                            Most of the games have you take on the role as a security guard, and you have to last
                            five nights at Freddy's security office. The series has very deep lore, and there are
                            multiple books
                            that accompany these games and add to the story. </p>

                        <p>Growing up, it was funny to watch what lengths Mr. MatPat had to go through to understand the
                            series'
                            storyline, with details and hints being very obscure and Scott Cawthon, the creator of the
                            series, changing
                            and retconning story elements all the time. The gameplay (up until Ultimate Custom Night,
                            where for me the fun
                            factor goes down a lot) is also very fun, having to stay in one place and use whatever tools
                            you have to survive.
