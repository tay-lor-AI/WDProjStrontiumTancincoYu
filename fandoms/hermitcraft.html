                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>Hermitcraft is a survival multiplayer series in Minecraft where a group of talented
                            Minecraft creators play together in 1 world. Typically, their definition of having
                            fun is creating long-term projects like massive, intricately detailed bases or very
                            technical builds like minigames, or both.
                            Along with these, the "hermits" interact with and have fun with each other, by having build
                            collaborations, doing challenges,
                            occasional wars and just goofing around. </p>

                            Hermitcraft is my comfort food. I watch them to just relax or calm down after a long day
                            at school, for example. They just have a very chill and fun vibe, and the creativity of each
                            hermit is just so inspiring and very yummy. The 11th world/season also just started, so now
                            is
                            a great time to being watching. - Xian
