                        <p>In a world where people gain superpowers from traumatic experiences, Taylor, a 14 year-old
                            girl with the power to control insects, wants to become a hero to escape from her pretty
                            stinky life. Of course, everything immediately goes wrong when she accidentally saves a 
                            local group of villains from a rivaling group, and now they think she is a villain as well 
                            and gives her an invitation to join.

                        <p>Worm is very long so it's kinda hard to get into, but the story flows pretty well and the 
                            writing quality is pretty consistently good throughout, which is nice for a long web serial. I really like how 
                            thought out and built the world is, with superpowered peoples tackled on a realistic angle. Also Taylor is an 
                            interesting unreliable narrator, seeing the horrid acts that she and the Undersiders as less bad than they actually 
                            are, and trying to justify the things she does with a noble-ish good cause. ilovweowmrrowokvwowrmivlvoewormwrowrjsm - Xian

                            Worm is a pretty interesting fandom that I kind of want to start reading, but i havent yet so i 
                            dont have any concrete opinions. u should try it out tho (xians holding me at gunpoint) - Emma
