                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>Hello Charlotte is an rpg-maker game series wherein you take the role of a Puppeteer guiding
                            the game's titular protagonist, Charlotte. You and your puppet traverse through surreal and
                            sometimes horrifying worlds, such as a realm made entirely of meat, a library born of your
                            mind, and school.

                        <p>Hello Charlotte was like the first little game series that I fully completed and I think
                            that did something to my brain yummy yummy. The series is a very novel experience and I just
                            like
                            weird and freaky deaky it is. The world and story is also very interesting with how similar
                            it is or how
                            it reflects an unstable mind, and it isn't really something you encounter much. Also Charlotte
                            (not Q84) is very small child and should be taken care of probably. - Xian
