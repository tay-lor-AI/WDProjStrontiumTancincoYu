                        <p>Critical Role is a channel on Youtube that upload their Dungeons and Dragons campaign on the
                            internet. The campagin players and Dungeon Masters are all popular voice actors. They also
                            have a patreon where they allow members to watch their episodes live, and also hold live
                            shows during local Comicons.</p>

                        <p>I've heard of D&D a bunch and always wanted to play it, just not having the time or people to
                            play with. Making your own story and doing your own thing is very fun, whether you do it yourself
                             or watch other people do it (I haven't been able to get into Critical Role due to Pisay time reasons 
                             as well so owie ow ow ouch). - Xian
